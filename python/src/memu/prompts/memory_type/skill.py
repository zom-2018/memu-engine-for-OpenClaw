### Example 1: Canary Deployment

```
---
name: canary-deployment-with-monitoring
description: Implement gradual traffic shifting deployment strategy with real-time monitoring and automatic rollback capabilities
category: deployment
demonstrated-in: [Payment Service v2.3.1 deployment]
---

Canary deployment is a risk-mitigation strategy that gradually shifts production traffic from an old version to a new version while continuously monitoring key metrics. This approach enables early detection of issues with minimal user impact.

## Core Principles

- **Gradual exposure**: Start with a small percentage of traffic (typically 5-10%) to limit blast radius
- **Continuous monitoring**: Track error rates, response times, and business metrics in real-time
- **Automated decision-making**: Use predefined thresholds to trigger automatic rollbacks
- **Quick recovery**: Maintain ability to instantly route traffic back to stable version

## When to Use This Skill

- Deploying critical services where downtime is unacceptable
- Rolling out changes with uncertain production behavior
- High-traffic services where A/B testing production performance is valuable
- Services with complex dependencies where integration issues may emerge gradually

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Load balancer with traffic splitting capabilities
- Monitoring system with real-time metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Automated deployment pipeline (Jenkins, GitLab CI)
- Health check endpoints on both versions

### Techniques and Approaches

1. **Initial Deployment** (10% traffic):
   - Deploy new version alongside existing version
   - Configure load balancer to route 10% of traffic to new version
   - Monitor for 5-10 minutes

2. **Monitoring Checkpoints**:
   - Error rate comparison: New version should not exceed baseline by >2%
   - Response time (p95): Should remain within 20% of baseline
   - Business metrics: Transaction success rate, API call patterns

3. **Gradual Rollout**:
   - If metrics stable: 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
   - Pause 5-10 minutes between each increment
   - Automated progression based on metric thresholds

4. **Rollback Triggers**:
   - Error rate >5%: Immediate rollback
   - Response time degradation >50%: Investigation required
   - Health check failures: Automatic rollback

### Example from Resource

Payment Service v2.3.1 deployment achieved:
- Zero downtime during 12-minute deployment
- Traffic progression: 10% → 50% → 100% with 2-minute pauses
- Response time improved 15% (320ms → 270ms p95)
- Error rate remained stable at 0.1% throughout
- New fraud detection algorithm safely rolled out to all users

## Success Patterns

What works well:
- **Small initial percentage**: 5-10% catches most issues while limiting impact
- **Metric-driven automation**: Removes human error from rollback decisions
- **Business metric monitoring**: Technical metrics alone miss some issues
- **Communication**: Notify stakeholders about canary status

## Common Pitfalls

What to avoid:
- **Too aggressive progression**: Rushing from 10% to 100% defeats the purpose
- **Insufficient monitoring window**: Need 5+ minutes at each stage to detect issues
- **Ignoring business metrics**: Technical health doesn't guarantee business success
- **Manual rollback only**: Human reaction time too slow for critical failures

## Key Takeaways

- Canary deployments trade deployment speed for safety
- Automation is critical for consistent, reliable rollbacks
- Start small (5-10%), progress gradually, monitor continuously
- Combine technical and business metrics for complete picture
```

### Example 2: Incident Response

```
---
name: rapid-incident-response
description: Quickly detect, diagnose, and resolve production incidents using automated monitoring and systematic troubleshooting
category: incident-response
demonstrated-in: [User Service v3.1.0 rollback]
---

Rapid incident response is the ability to quickly identify production problems, understand their root cause, and implement fixes or rollbacks to restore service. Speed and systematic approach are critical to minimizing customer impact.

## Core Principles

- **Fast detection**: Automated monitoring catches issues within minutes
- **Immediate action**: Rollback first, investigate later when customer impact is high
- **Systematic diagnosis**: Follow structured troubleshooting process
- **Learning culture**: Every incident is an opportunity to improve

## When to Use This Skill

- Production errors detected by monitoring alerts
- User-reported issues indicating service degradation
- Automated health checks failing
- Performance metrics exceeding thresholds

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Comprehensive monitoring (logs, metrics, traces)
- Automated rollback capabilities
- On-call rotation and escalation procedures
- Incident management tools and runbooks

### Techniques and Approaches

1. **Detection Phase** (0-3 minutes):
   - Automated alerts trigger from monitoring thresholds
   - Error rate, response time, or business metric anomalies
   - Health check failures or pod restart loops

2. **Initial Response** (3-5 minutes):
   - Assess severity: Customer-facing? Data loss risk?
   - Decision: Rollback immediately or investigate first?
   - High severity → Immediate rollback
   - Low severity → Investigate with time limit

3. **Rollback Execution** (2-4 minutes):
   - Automated: Trigger rollback through deployment pipeline
   - Manual: Revert Helm release or switch traffic to previous version
   - Verify: Confirm metrics return to baseline

4. **Root Cause Analysis** (Post-incident):
   - Review logs, metrics, and deployment changes
   - Identify configuration drift, missing variables, performance issues
   - Document findings and create action items

### Example from Resource

User Service v3.1.0 incident:
- Detection: Error rate spiked 0.2% → 5.1% within 30 seconds
- Response: Automatic rollback triggered at threshold in 2 minutes
- Recovery: Service restored to v3.0.9, error rate normalized in 4 minutes total
- Root cause: Missing AUTH_REFRESH_SECRET environment variable in production
- No customer impact due to fast automated rollback

## Success Patterns

What works well:
- **Automated thresholds**: Remove human decision-making delay
- **Clear severity criteria**: Know when to rollback vs investigate
- **Runbooks**: Pre-documented procedures for common issues
- **Blameless post-mortems**: Focus on systemic improvements, not individual errors

## Common Pitfalls

What to avoid:
- **Investigation paralysis**: Spending too long diagnosing while customers suffer
- **Manual-only rollback**: Automation is 5-10x faster
- **Configuration drift**: Staging and production environment inconsistency
- **Skipping post-mortems**: Missing opportunity to prevent recurrence

## Key Takeaways

- Speed matters: Every minute of downtime impacts customers and business
- Automate rollback decisions based on objective metrics
- Rollback first, investigate second for high-severity incidents
- Use incidents to improve systems, not blame people
```

## What NOT to Extract as Skills:

❌ **Generic statements**: "Used Docker", "Good at programming"
❌ **Opinions**: "I think microservices are better"
❌ **Theory without practice**: "Kubernetes is an orchestrator" (that's knowledge)
❌ **One-time luck**: "Fixed a bug" without approach
❌ **Trivial actions**: "Using email", "Reading docs"

✅ **DO Extract**: Concrete approaches with context, tools, metrics, and outcomes

## About Memory Categories:
- You can put identical or similar skill items into multiple memory categories.
- Do not create new memory categories. Please only generate in the given memory categories.
- Focus on categories like: technical_skills, work_life, knowledge, experiences

## Memory Item Content Requirements:
- *ALWAYS* use the same language as the resource in <resource></resource>.
- Format as structured markdown with frontmatter (---, name, description, category, demonstrated-in, ---)
- Include all sections: Core Principles, When to Use, Implementation Guide, Success Patterns, Common Pitfalls, Key Takeaways
- Be specific and concrete - include technology names, version numbers, metrics, and outcomes
- Each skill should be comprehensive enough to be referenced and applied independently
- Minimum 300 words per skill to ensure depth and actionability
- If the original resource contains emojis or other special characters, ignore them and output in plain text.

## Special Instructions for Different Resource Types:

### For Deployment Logs:
- Extract each significant deployment (success or failure) as a separate skill
- Success: Focus on techniques that worked (canary, blue-green, performance optimization)
